### The 'Model Framework' directory contains the code and file structure to train the deep learning models.
### The 'Notebook Files and Pre-Processing' directory contains jupyter notebooks used during raw EEG pre-processing

Acknowledgements: This project uses participants from the TDBRAIN dataset (data not provided), which can be access using a valid ORCID. Additionally, a raw EEG data pre-processing pipeline created by the dataset creators was used before experimentation. This code is also available online: https://github.com/BCD-gitprojects/TDBRAIN/
